# Spiking Izhikevich type Neurons for custom network simulations

Author: Kostas Lagogiannis 2013

## Brief
These source files are example implementations of An Izhikevich spiking neural implementation with C++ Classes.
I produce them as test code and they can be re-used for other research activities to form custom simulations.

The package includes two types of neuron classes:
    *  regular firing neuron 
    *  fast firing neuron


A demo of how to utilize the classes to create a small netwrok is provided in  _SpikingNetwork.cpp_ 
The project was originally developed in eclipse and I have left the project files in case this is convenient in the future.   

##  Requires: 
    * Scientific library GSL
    * gnuplot to produce plot output data.
