#Brief: These source files are example implementations of An Izhikevich spiking neural implementation with C++ Classes.
I produce them as test code and they can be re-used for other research activities to form custom simulations.

# SpikeNetworks
SpikingNeural Nets Test and training code
The package includes two types of neuron classes:
*a regular firing neuron 
*a fast firing neuron


-Requires: 
*Scientific library GSL
*and it uses gnuplot to produce plot output data.
